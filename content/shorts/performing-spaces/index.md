For the first time dance has been  recorded by Rudolf Laban through the use of drawing, who developed a notational system called "Labanotation" Labanotation was purely a geometrical record of every move performed by a dancer, similarly to a plan or section drawing in architecture. Labanâ€™s theory revolved around the idea that the existence of space is only acknowledged through movement. "Each body forms a continuum with" the space which in itself is in motion.

"Performing Space" is a visual portrayal of the close relationship between the boundaries of the space to the body.
